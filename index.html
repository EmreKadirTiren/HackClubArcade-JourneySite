                    <p>The summer had just begun and I received a email from github education. I always wanted to receive those mails as I loved to read them about. And when I read about Hackclub I read about Hackclub and wanted to join them because, well PRIZES!!! 
                    But also because I could join a community with people like me who like to code and learn new things.</p>

                    <p>The pojects I first made were things like a C# console app, and simpele sites. Here I got used with using HTML, CSS and javascript.</p>
                    <p>Then I used to work with API's. Wich at first was pretty hard because you need to hide them and now how to send a request and how to process the response. While learning how to work with API's I made a weather graph, flighttracker javascript clock and Weather App.</p>

                    <p>I am reading a lot of books this summer and what better than code a site wheren users can post their review on the book. So I started to code a page with homepage, ligt/darkmode, books, author's page and much more. If you want to view it go here: </p>

                <p>After the BookReviewSite I wanted to make projects that I care about. So after a short pause and a lot of thinking I came up with a few ideas...</p>

                <p>I had an idea I always wanted a pickbord where I can put my ideas on a stickynote throw it on a wall and connect it. And important I can access it from ANYWHERE! So I made it  using a database a server.js and a simpele HTML site. In the end it became a tool I often use.</p>

                <p>I am moving soon not to far a way from where I am living now but far enough to put everything in boxes. And to make my life easyer and identify what is in each box I made a site wich puts the box id, category, content password in a database. I learned how to create users how to store them in a database. But more importantly I learned to create my own API's and I...
